1. Keep your commits atomic.
2. Commit messages should either be in present imperative tense or past tense.
3. To write longer commit messages we can us VS Code editor. Command to be used - git commit. 
This will open VS Code only if we have configured git by implementing the following command:
git config --global core.editor "code --wait".
If we write long commit messages, then git log too will display these long messages. For that we can
do 2 things:
a. In our commit message we can first write a short heading followed by rest of the content.
b. To see our commits, we can do git log --oneline instead of git log.
