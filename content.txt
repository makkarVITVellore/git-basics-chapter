1. A Git Repository is basically a workspace which tracks and manages files within a folder. Anytime we
want to use Git with a project, app,etc. we need to create a new Git repository. We can have as many
repos on our machine as needed, all with separate histories and contents.

2. Git status gives information on the current status of a git repository and its contents. 

3. Use git init to create a new git repository. This is something you do once per project. Initialize
the repo in the top-level folder containing your project.
